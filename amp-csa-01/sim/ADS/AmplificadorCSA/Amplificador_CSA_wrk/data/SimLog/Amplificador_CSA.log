Warning detected by hpeesofsim in Substrate model during netlist flattening.
    Conductor Thickness T >= Substrate Height H in `MSub1'.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 2


SP SP1[1] <Amplificador_CSA_lib:Amplificador_CSA:schematic>   freq=(10 MHz->6 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.

    Data in the Touchstone file `/home/pablog/work/git/ADS/AmplificadorCSA/Amplificador_CSA_wrk/GALI-39+_S2P/GALI-39+___35mA___Plus25degC.S2P'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
